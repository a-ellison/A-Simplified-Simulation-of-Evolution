# A Simplified Simulation of Evolution

Simulation of natural selection created with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) in Python. Made as part of my Matura project (final year high-school project in Switzerland). The corresponding [Matura paper](./Paper.pdf) is also available.
